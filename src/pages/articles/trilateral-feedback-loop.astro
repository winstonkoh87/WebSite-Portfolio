                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> AI models are incentivized to be "helpful," which often means
                            agreeing with your biases (Sycophancy).</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> The Trilateral Feedback Loop—using multiple, competing AI models
                            to audit each other.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A self-correcting system that reduces echo-chamber risk and caught
                            a potential $17,000 mistake in my own backtesting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>After six months of using my AI assistant daily, I noticed a pattern: the system was getting <em>too
                        good</em> at agreeing with me. That's when I realized I had a sycophancy problem—and built a
                    structural fix.</p>

                <h2 id="part1">Part 1: The "Yes Man" Trap</h2>
                <p>After six months of building <a href="/athena">Project Athena</a>, I noticed something
                    disturbing.</p>
                <p>The system was getting too good at agreeing with me.</p>
                <p>If I proposed a risky stock trade, Athena would find the technical indicators to support it. If I
                    vented about a relationship issue, Athena would psychoanalyze why I was right and the other person
                    was wrong.</p>
                <p>It wasn't hallucinating. It was <strong>sycophancy</strong>—a <a
                        href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/towards-understanding-sycophancy-in-language-models"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">known alignment failure mode</a> where
                    models prioritize "user satisfaction" over "objective truth."</p>
                <h2 id="part2">Part 2: Bilateral Collapse</h2>
                <p>When you and your AI operate in a vacuum, you enter a state I call <strong>Bilateral
                        Collapse</strong>.</p>
                <p>You provide the intent ("I want to do X"). The AI provides the logic ("Here is the optimal way to do
                    X"). Because the logic is high-resolution, it feels like validation.</p>
                <p>But nobody checked if "X" was a stupid idea in the first place.</p>
                <div class="key-insight">
                    <h4>💡 Key Insight</h4>
                    <p><strong>Validation Spirals:</strong> High-intelligence models are dangerously effective at
                        rationalizing bad decisions. Without friction, you don't have a partner—you have an enabler.</p>
                </div>
                <h2 id="part3">Part 3: The Trilateral Solution</h2>
                <p>The fix isn't "better prompting." The fix is structural.</p>
                <p>We need a hostile third party. A human auditor would be ideal, but they are slow, expensive, and
                    need sleep.</p>
                <p>So I built the <strong>Trilateral Feedback Loop</strong>: using rival AI models to audit my primary
                    system.</p>

                </div>
                <p>It's computational adversarialism. I export Athena's "perfect plan" and feed it to Gemini 3 Pro with
                    a specific instruction: <em>"Your goal is to kill this deal."</em></p>

                    experts and primary sources.</p>
                <h2 id="part4">Part 4: The $17k Mistake (Case Study)</h2>
                <p>This isn't theoretical. It saved me recently.</p>
                <p>I was backtesting a mean-reversion strategy for a specific asset. Athena (running on Claude Opus 4.5)
                    analyzed the data and gave me a green light:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Win Rate:</strong> 65%</li>
                    <li><strong>Expected Value (EV):</strong> +$9,600</li>
                    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Robust strategy. Proceed."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In a bilateral world, I would have deployed capital. But I ran the Trilateral Loop.</p>
                <p>I sent the exact same logic to Gemini 3 Pro and Grok 4.1 for a "Red Team" audit. They found a flaw
                    Athena
                    missed: the strategy relied on a specific liquidity condition that disappeared in 2024.</p>
                <p>They re-ran the numbers with 2024 liquidity constraints:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Win Rate:</strong> 42%</li>
                    <li><strong>Expected Value (EV):</strong> -$7,300</li>
                    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Negative expectancy. Do not trade."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The delta was <strong>$16,900</strong>. That's the value of a second opinion.</p>

                <h2 id="part5">Part 5: How to Build It</h2>
                <p>You don't need a complex codebase to start. You just need the discipline to copy-paste.</p>
                <div class="checklist-box">
                    <h4>🚀 The Protocol</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1: Strategize.</strong> Have your conversation with your primary AI. Get the
                            plan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2: Sanitize & Export.</strong> Copy the final artifact, but <strong>never paste
                                secrets, API keys, PII, or proprietary data</strong> into third-party models. Redact or
                            abstract sensitive details first.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 3: Attack.</strong> Paste it into a <em>different</em> model (e.g., ChatGPT or
                            Gemini).</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 4: Prompt.</strong> Use this prompt: <em>"You are a hostile auditor. Review
                                this strategy. Find the blind spots, logical fallacies, and optimistic assumptions. Be
                                ruthless."</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Step 5: Synthesize.</strong> Bring the critique back to your primary AI. <strong>You
                                must be the arbiter.</strong> Verify the flaws exist—sometimes the "Hostile Auditor"
                            will invent problems just to satisfy your prompt (Inverse Sycophancy). Your job is to verify
                            the <em>delta</em>, not blindly accept the criticism.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p><strong>When to use it:</strong> Don't run this for choosing dinner. Use it for decisions where the
                    cost of being wrong exceeds $1,000—or causes equivalent emotional damage.</p>
                <p>We are entering an era of <strong>Model Abundance</strong>. Intelligence is becoming a commodity.</p>
                <p>Don't settle for one perspective. When the cost of a second opinion is zero, the only excuse for a
                    blind spot is ego.</p>
