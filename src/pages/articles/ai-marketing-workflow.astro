                <div class="exec-summary" style="background: rgba(234, 179, 8, 0.1); border-color: rgba(234, 179, 8, 0.3);">
                    <h4>⚠️ Transparency Note</h4>
                    <p>This is a <strong>methodology demonstration</strong> — not an actual client engagement. The case study is <strong>inspired by Coach Derrick Lim</strong>, a real Singapore swim coach whose public profile (TikTok followers, Google rating) I observed at time of research.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observable signals are real.</strong> At time of viewing, Coach Derrick had ~30K TikTok followers and a 5.0★ Google rating — publicly verifiable. <strong>All financial projections, revenue estimates, and strategic recommendations are AI-generated</strong> for demonstration purposes.</p>
                    <p>I created this pitch deck as a portfolio exercise. <strong>No deal has been closed.</strong> The value is in the reusable workflow, not the specific numbers.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Executive Summary Box -->
                <div class="exec-summary">
                    <h4>📋 What I Built</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Industry Analysis:</strong> PESTLE + Porter's Five Forces for Singapore private swim coaching</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Audit:</strong> Business Model Canvas + Pro Forma Financials + SWOT/TOWS</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Recommendations:</strong> 4-pillar transformation plan with timeline + costs</li>
                        <li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> 30-page strategy document + Interactive pitch deck website</li>
                        <li><strong>Time:</strong> ~4-5 hours (one afternoon)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>The Setup</h2>
                <p>I spotted <strong>Coach Derrick Lim</strong> on TikTok — 30K+ followers, 5-star Google reviews, clearly competent at his craft. Classic profile: <strong>strong organic reach, but weak conversion infrastructure</strong>. Great at coaching, but no funnel, no packaging, no monetization system.</p>
                <p>I decided to use his public profile as inspiration for a demo case study. Not because I had a client — but because I wanted to stress-test a question:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>How fast can I go from "zero context" to "pitch-ready strategy" using an AI-augmented workflow?</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The answer: <strong>one afternoon</strong>.</p>

                <h2 id="time">Part 3: The Time Breakdown</h2>
                <p>Here's how the afternoon actually went:</p>

                <div class="timeline">
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <strong>0:00 - 0:45 — Industry Research</strong>
                        <p>PESTLE and Five Forces. I provided Singapore-specific context (coach registration requirements, local parenting culture, condo facility rules). The AI structured it into frameworks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <strong>0:45 - 1:30 — Business Audit</strong>
                        <p>Business Model Canvas, estimated financials, SWOT/TOWS. Financials are projections based on visible pricing and industry benchmarks — not actual data. These would vary significantly coach to coach.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <strong>1:30 - 2:15 — Strategic Synthesis</strong>
                        <p>This is where human judgment matters. The AI doesn't "know" that the adult learner segment might be underserved or that outcome-based pricing tends to beat hourly rates. I articulated hypotheses based on TikTok comments and Google reviews; the AI structured them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <strong>2:15 - 3:00 — Recommendations + Timeline</strong>
                        <p>4-pillar strategy, 90-day roadmap, ROI projections, risk matrix. This is synthesis, not generation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <strong>3:00 - 4:00 — Presentation Layer</strong>
                        <p>Built the interactive deck as a standalone HTML page. This took longer than necessary — I over-engineered it for my portfolio.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="key-insight">
                    <h4>💡 The Real Time Sink</h4>
                    <p>The deck (Part 5) was vanity engineering. For an actual client pitch, a PDF + WhatsApp voice note would have sufficed.</p>
                    <p>If I were optimizing for pure speed: <strong>~2.5 hours</strong> to produce a pitch-ready PDF.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="sources">Part 4: Data Sources & Verification</h2>
                <p>Since the red-team asked: where did the Singapore-specific claims come from?</p>

                <div class="checklist-box">
                    <h4>📚 Sources Used</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>NROC Registration:</strong> Coaches in Singapore can register under the <a href="https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/athletes-coaches/coaches-corner/national-registry-of-coaches-(nroc)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Registry of Coaches (NROC)</a> via Sport Singapore. NROC membership is <em>required</em> to coach at ActiveSG pools and some condo facilities, though not universally mandatory for all private coaching.</li>
                        <li><strong>ActiveSG Pool Usage:</strong> Per <a href="https://www.activesgcircle.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActiveSG Circle</a>, swimming coaches need a valid NROC certification and Usage Permit to coach in ActiveSG facilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Condo MCST Rules:</strong> Under the <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA)</a>, MCSTs can establish by-laws governing common facilities. Many condos require external coaches to register with management, limit coaching to residents only, and restrict session times — though policies vary by estate.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Kiasu" Culture:</strong> A widely-used Singaporean term meaning "afraid to lose," describing competitive parenting behaviour, particularly around enrichment activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="key-insight">
                    <h4>⚠️ Verification Note</h4>
                    <p>These are based on publicly available guidelines and common industry knowledge. For a live engagement, I would verify specific regulations with the relevant authorities (SportSG, specific MCST management offices) before making recommendations.</p>
                    <p><strong>The financials are estimates.</strong> Revenue, margins, and student counts are educated guesses based on visible pricing and industry benchmarks — not actual data from the business. In any real pitch, these would need validation.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="junior">Part 5: The "Junior Marketer" Question</h2>
                <p>The obvious comparison: <em>"How long would this take without AI?"</em></p>
                <p>Let me reframe that question — because the original framing is unfair.</p>

                <div class="table-wrapper">
                    <table class="comparison-table">
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="col">Comparison</th>
                                <th scope="col">What It Actually Tests</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>❌ Senior + AI vs Junior + Manual</td>
                                <td>Experience gap + Tool gap (unfair stacking)</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>✅ Senior + AI vs Senior + Manual</td>
                                <td>Tool leverage (fair comparison)</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>✅ Junior + AI vs Junior + Manual</td>
                                <td>Tool leverage independent of experience</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>

                <p>The honest claim isn't <em>"I'm faster than a junior"</em> — it's <strong>"the process changed for everyone."</strong></p>

                <h3>The New Junior Role</h3>
                <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth and the opportunity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Old model:</strong> Junior spends 10 hours on research, compiling tabs, formatting PPT</li>
                    <li><strong>New model:</strong> Junior directs AI on what to research, then does QC and fact-checking</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The grunt work isn't eliminated — it's <strong>compressed and restructured</strong>. A junior marketer with good prompting skills and a critical eye for BS can now produce equivalent output in a fraction of the time.</p>
                <p>This doesn't destroy the learning curve. It <strong>accelerates it</strong>. Instead of spending a week learning "how to compile industry research," you spend a day learning "how to verify AI-generated industry research." The meta-skill (critical evaluation) is actually more valuable.</p>

                <div class="key-insight">
                    <h4>💡 The Training Ground Shift</h4>
                    <p>If you're a junior: your job isn't to open 100 tabs anymore. It's to <strong>direct the AI, verify the output, and add the judgment it can't</strong>. That's a more valuable skill set — and it develops faster.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="limits">Part 6: What This Doesn't Prove</h2>
                <p>Let me be explicit about the limitations:</p>

                    <h4>🚫 What This Case Study Does NOT Demonstrate</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>That the strategy is validated:</strong> I haven't interviewed actual parents or swimmers. In a real engagement, Day 2+ would involve calling 5-10 customers to validate assumptions.</li>
                        <li><strong>That the financials are accurate:</strong> All numbers are educated estimates, not verified actuals. These would vary significantly business to business.</li>
                        <li><strong>That the pitch converts:</strong> This is a demo, not a closed deal. No money has changed hands.</li>
                        <li><strong>That AI replaces strategic thinking:</strong> I provided the judgment calls and hypotheses; AI provided structure and speed.</li>
                        <li><strong>That agencies are obsolete:</strong> Good agencies provide QA, liability protection, primary research, and domain expertise that this demo lacks.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>What it <em>does</em> demonstrate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>production speed</strong> of strategic artefacts has collapsed</li>
                    <li>The <strong>barrier to creating pitch-ready drafts</strong> is now hours, not weeks</li>
                    <li>The <strong>value differentiator</strong> shifts from "production capacity" to "strategic judgment," "validation rigour," and "execution follow-through"</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="steal">Part 7: What You Can Steal</h2>
                
                <h3>The Research Stack</h3>
                <p>Use this sequence for any industry analysis:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>PESTLE</strong> — Macro forces (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)</li>
                    <li><strong>Five Forces</strong> — Industry attractiveness (New Entrants, Buyer Power, Supplier Power, Substitutes, Rivalry)</li>
                    <li><strong>BMC</strong> — Business model of the specific company</li>
                    <li><strong>SWOT/TOWS</strong> — Strategic position and options</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommendations</strong> — What to actually do</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Each layer feeds the next. Don't skip the sequence — the TOWS is meaningless without the SWOT, which is meaningless without the BMC, which is meaningless without understanding the industry.</p>

                <h3>The Workflow Pattern</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>You provide context:</strong> Industry-specific knowledge, local regulations, cultural nuance</li>
                    <li><strong>AI provides structure:</strong> Framework templates, synthesis, formatting</li>
                    <li><strong>You provide judgment:</strong> "This insight matters," "This recommendation is actionable," "This number smells wrong"</li>
                    <li><strong>AI provides speed:</strong> First drafts, iteration, presentation</li>
                    <li><strong>You provide verification:</strong> Fact-check sources, validate with cursory competitor research, flag what needs customer interviews</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>The Output Stack</h3>
                <p>Don't stop at a PDF. Build something the client can <em>experience</em>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interactive website (even if over-engineered for the context)</li>
                    <li>Working prototype</li>
                    <li>Demo they can click through</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This shifts the conversation from "here's my recommendation" to "here's what it looks like." Concrete beats abstract.</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>One afternoon produced:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A complete industry analysis</li>
                    <li>A strategic audit with estimated financials</li>
                    <li>A 4-pillar recommendation set</li>
                    <li>A 90-day execution roadmap</li>
                    <li>An interactive pitch deck</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Is it as rigorous as a 3-week consulting engagement with customer interviews and validated financials? No.</p>
                <p>Is it good enough to start a conversation and demonstrate capability? Yes.</p>
                <p><strong>Why "$5K-worth"?</strong> Agency discovery phases (industry analysis + business audit + strategic recommendations) typically cost $2,000-$5,000 for comparable scope. By collapsing the drafting phase, I produced equivalent deliverables in one afternoon.</p>
                <p>The leverage isn't "AI does my thinking." It's <strong>"AI does my drafting, so I can focus on thinking and verification."</strong></p>
