                        <li><strong>The Trap:</strong> Confusing "Building Fast" (Velocity) with "Building Right" (Vector).</li>
                        <li><strong>The Reality:</strong> AI has reduced the cost of <em>Product</em> to zero, but the cost of <em>Distribution</em> (Market/Channel) has skyrocketed due to noise.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Lesson:</strong> "Gatekeeping" is dead (see Stack Overflow). You cannot monetize access to information anymore.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Fix:</strong> Use the "Mall Test" and "Interface Test" before writing a single line of code.</li>

                <h2>The "I Built 10 Apps" Problem</h2>
                <p>There is a thread on Reddit right now that perfectly captures the current moment in software.</p>
                <p>A user writes: <em>"I've coded like 10 apps since Dec 31st... from micro SaaS to Chrome extensions... I feel like I've gained another superpower, but I'm still stuck in the same place: I don't know how to monetize my skill."</em></p>
                <p>This is what I call <strong>The Vibe Coder's Trap</strong>.</p>
                <p>AI tools like Cursor and v0 have given us god-like powers of creation. We can manifest software at the speed of thought. The dopamine hit is incredible. You have an idea, you prompt it, and 30 minutes later, it exists.</p>
                <p>But businesses are not built on existence. They are built on <strong>Physics</strong>.</p>

                <h2 id="lesson1">Part 1: The Death of Gatekeeping (Stack Overflow)</h2>
                <p>If you want to see what happens when you ignore market physics, look at Stack Overflow.</p>
                <p>For years, Stack Overflow held a monopoly on developer knowledge. Their model relied on <strong>Gatekeeping</strong>: "Closed as duplicate," "Read the documentation," and snarky comments from power users. It was a <strong>High-Friction Interface</strong> to knowledge.</p>
                <p>Then came ChatGPT. It offered a <strong>Zero-Judgment Interface</strong>. It didn't mock you for not knowing; it just gave you the answer.</p>
                
                <figure class="article-figure">
                    <Image 
                        src={stackoverflowImg} 
                        alt="Stack Overflow Decline Chart" 
                        class="article-image"
                    />
                    <figcaption>The moment the "Gatekeeper" died. Frictionless utility (AI) always kills high-friction arrogance.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> You cannot gatekeep knowledge anymore. The moment a lower-friction interface appeared, the incumbent collapsed. If your business model relies on "access to information" or "technical difficulty," you are walking dead.</p>

                <h2 id="lesson2">Part 2: Execution is the Bottleneck</h2>
                <p>The Vibe Coder often complains: <em>"I just don't know what to build."</em></p>
                <p>This is an illusion. Ideas are not the bottleneck.</p>

                <figure class="article-figure">
                    <Image 
                        src={executionImg} 
                        alt="Execution Bottleneck" 
                        class="article-image"
                    />
                    <figcaption>The funnel of reality. Ideas are plentiful and cheap. Execution is the narrow, painful filter that creates value.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Go to a shopping mall. Look at what people are buying. Go to TikTok. Look at what people are complaining about. Go to a construction site. Look at the messy clipboards they are using.</p>
                <p><strong>The market is screaming its needs at you every day.</strong></p>
                <p>The problem isn't the <em>Idea</em>. It’s the <strong>Execution</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A founder doesn't fail because they lacked the "idea" for a blog. They fail because they didn't have the discipline to write 1 post day, every day, for 2 years.</li>
                    <li>They fail because they built a $10 product but didn't have the resources to run a $50 CPM ad campaign.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finding the problem is easy. Building the solution is now easy (thanks to AI). <strong>Connecting the two (Execution)</strong> is where the pain—and the profit—lives.</p>

                <h2 id="fits">Part 3: The 4 Fits (The Physics Check)</h2>
                <p>Brian Balfour (ex-VP Growth at HubSpot) coined the "4 Fits" framework. If one link breaks, the business dies. AI helps you with none of these.</p>

                <figure class="article-figure">
                    <Image 
                        src={fourFitsImg}

                        class="article-image"
                    />
                    <figcaption>The Chain of Business Physics. AI supercharges the "Product" link, but if Market, Channel, or Model are weak, the chain snaps.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <div class="checklist-box">
                    <h4>The Chain of Survival</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1. Market-Product Fit:</strong> Are you solving a searing pain for a specific person? (AI asks "Is code correct?"; Business asks "Is this useful?")</li>
                        <li><strong>2. Product-Channel Fit:</strong> Is your product built to grow deeply in a specific channel? (e.g., SEO, Virality, Sales).</li>
                        <li><strong>3. Channel-Model Fit:</strong> Does your price point support your channel? (You can't sell a $10 app via Sales calls).</li>
                        <li><strong>4. Model-Market Fit:</strong> Is the market big enough to support your model?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2 id="decision">Part 4: The "Go/No-Go" Decision Tree</h2>
                <p>Before you prompt your next app, run this simple diagnostics check.</p>

                <div class="key-insight">
                    <h4>🚦 The Diagnostics Check</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: The Mall Test (Market)</strong><br>
                    Did I see a real human trying to solve this problem and failing?<br>
                    <strong>YES:</strong> Proceed. | <strong>NO:</strong> Stop. You are hallucinating a market.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 2: The Interface Test (Product)</strong><br>
                    Is my solution "Zero-Judgment" and lower friction than the status quo (like ChatGPT vs Stack Overflow)?<br>
                    <strong>YES:</strong> Proceed. | <strong>NO:</strong> Stop.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 3: The Math Test (Model)</strong><br>
                    Cost to Acquire (Time + Ads) &lt; Lifetime Value (Price)?<br>
                    <strong>YES:</strong> Proceed. | <strong>NO:</strong> Stop. You are building a charity.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2 class="final-word">The Final Word</h2>
                <p>Stop celebrating "10 apps in a week." <br>Celebrate "1 business that fits."</p>
                <p>The code is free. The strategy is priceless.</p>
