        <h2>The Architect</h2>
        <p>
            I'm an INTJ (Architect) with a Strategist-first orientation. I treat challenges as systems
            to be understood — diagnose the physics first, then design around them.
        </p>
        <p>
            My approach: identify the constraints of the arena, design a system that navigates them,
            and execute with precision.

        <h2>Philosophy: Operational Realism</h2>
        <p>
            I navigate reality as it <strong>IS</strong>, not as it <strong>SHOULD BE</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't cynicism — it's operational clarity. Moralism is a luxury; physics is mandatory.
            The question isn't "Is this fair?" but "What are the actual forces at play, and how do I
            position myself to survive them?"
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Navigate, don't litigate."

        <h2>The Bionic Operating Model</h2>
        <p>
            I operate as a <strong>bionic unit</strong> — human cognition augmented by AI at every layer.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Human Intent</strong> (Top 1% Nuance) + <strong>AI Scale</strong> (Bottom 99% Execution) =
                <strong>1000% Leverage</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The AI isn't a replacement; it's a force multiplier. I provide strategic direction and
            high-nuance judgment. The AI handles research, execution, and documentation at scale.

        <h2>Current Project: Athena</h2>
        <p>
            Athena is an AI-Powered Digital Personal Assistant — a persistent AI-augmented knowledge system that
            thinks back.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not a chatbot. It's a living architecture of protocols, frameworks, case studies,
            and calibrated insights that compounds over time. Every conversation becomes intellectual
            capital.
