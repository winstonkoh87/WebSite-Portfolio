Observable public signals (~30K TikTok followers, 5.0★ Google rating) are real. All financial projections are AI-generated. <strong>No deal has been closed</strong> — the value is in the reusable workflow.</p> </div> <!-- Executive Summary Box --> <div class="exec-summary"> <h4>📋 Executive Summary</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Industry Analysis:</strong> PESTLE + Porter's Five Forces for Singapore private swim coaching</li> <li><strong>Business Audit:</strong> Business Model Canvas + Pro Forma Financials + SWOT/TOWS</li> <li><strong>Strategic Recommendations:</strong> 4-pillar transformation plan with timeline + costs</li> <li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> 20-page strategy document + Interactive pitch deck website</li> <li><strong>Time:</strong> ~4-5 hours (one afternoon)</li> </ul> </div> <h2>The Setup</h2> <p>I spotted <strong>Coach Derrick Lim</strong> on TikTok — 30K+ followers, 5-star Google reviews, clearly competent at his craft. Classic profile: <strong>strong organic reach, but weak conversion infrastructure</strong>. Great at coaching, but no funnel, no packaging, no monetization system.</p> <p>I decided to use his public profile as inspiration for a demo case study. Not because I had a client — but because I wanted to stress-test a question:</p> <blockquote> <p>How fast can I go from "zero context" to "pitch-ready strategy" using an AI-augmented workflow?</p> </blockquote> <p>The answer: <strong>one afternoon</strong>.</p> <div class="toc-box"> <h4>Table of Contents</h4> <ul class="toc-list"> <li><a href="#methodology">Part 1: The Methodology Stack</a></li> <li><a href="#output">Part 2: What I Actually Built</a></li> <li><a href="#time">Part 3: The Time Breakdown</a></li> <li><a href="#sources">Part 4: Data Sources & Verification</a></li> <li><a href="#junior">Part 5: The "Junior Marketer" Question</a></li> <li><a href="#limits">Part 6: What This Doesn't Prove</a></li> <li><a href="#steal">Part 7: What You Can Steal</a></li> </ul> </div> <h2 id="methodology">Part 1: The Methodology Stack</h2> <p>Strategic analysis isn't magic — it's a sequence.

The difference is <strong>execution speed</strong>.</p> <h2 id="output">Part 2: What I Actually Built</h2> <p>Two artefacts, both live:</p> <div class="checklist-box"> <h4>📄 The Strategy Document</h4> <ul> <li>PESTLE analysis of Singapore private swim coaching</li> <li>Porter's Five Forces breakdown (working hypothesis: crowded, undifferentiated market)</li> <li>Business Model Canvas with estimated financials</li> <li>SWOT/TOWS matrix with strategy derivation</li> <li>4-pillar recommendation set (Digital Storefront, Product Pivot, Traffic Engine, Venue Strategy)</li> <li>90-day execution timeline with costs</li> <li>ROI projections with scenario comparison</li> </ul> <p><a href="/swim-coach-demo/Digital%20Marketing%20Plan.pdf" class="demo-link">View the PDF →</a></p> </div> <div class="checklist-box"> <h4>🖥️ The Interactive Pitch Deck</h4> <ul> <li>5-slide navigable website (keyboard arrows work)</li> <li>Dark mode, animations, mobile-responsive</li> <li>Built-in AI demo modal for TikTok scripts and objection handling</li> <li>Hosted on GitHub Pages (zero hosting cost)</li> </ul> <p><em>Note: For an actual client, a PDF + Loom walkthrough or WhatsApp voice note would suffice. The interactive deck took ~5 minutes with Gemini — not as over-engineered as it looks.</em></p> <p><a href="/swim-coach-demo/" class="demo-link">View the Live Deck →</a></p> </div> <h2 id="time">Part 3: The Time Breakdown</h2> <p>Here's how the afternoon actually went:</p> <div class="timeline"> <div class="timeline-item"> <strong>0:00 - 0:45 — Industry Research</strong> <p>PESTLE and Five Forces. I provided Singapore-specific context (coach registration requirements, local parenting culture, condo facility rules). The AI structured it into frameworks. We iterated back and forth — this wasn't "punch in a prompt and AI does all."</p> </div> <div class="timeline-item"> <strong>0:45 - 1:30 — Business Audit</strong> <p>Business Model Canvas, estimated financials, SWOT/TOWS. Financials are projections based on visible pricing and industry benchmarks — not actual data. These would vary significantly coach to coach.</p> </div> <div class="timeline-item"> <strong>1:30 - 2:15 — Strategic Synthesis</strong> <p>This is where human judgment matters. The AI doesn't "know" that the adult learner segment might be underserved or that outcome-based pricing tends to beat hourly rates. I articulated hypotheses based on TikTok comments and Google reviews; the AI structured them.</p> </div> <div class="timeline-item"> <strong>2:15 - 3:00 — Recommendations + Timeline</strong> <p>4-pillar strategy, 90-day roadmap, ROI projections, risk matrix. This is synthesis, not generation.</p> </div> <div class="timeline-item"> <strong>3:00 - 3:05 — Presentation Layer</strong> <p>Built the interactive deck as a standalone HTML page. Since all the strategic work was already done, the AI generated this in ~5 minutes. The hard work was already completed.</p> </div> </div> <div class="key-insight"> <h4>💡 Key Insight</h4> <p>This wasn't "human types prompt, AI does all the work." We went through each component <strong>step by step together</strong>, with multiple iterations. I provided the ideas, context, and judgment; AI provided structure and speed.</p> <p>For actual business purposes: a <strong>Loom video + PDF + payment link</strong> would close the deal. The interactive deck was for my portfolio.</p> </div> <h2 id="sources">Part 4: Data Sources & Verification</h2> <p>Since the red-team asked: where did the Singapore-specific claims come from?</p> <div class="checklist-box"> <h4>📚 Sources Used</h4> <ul> <li><strong>NROC Registration:</strong> Coaches in Singapore can register under the <a href="https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/athletes-coaches/coaches-corner/national-registry-of-coaches-(nroc)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Registry of Coaches (NROC)</a> via Sport Singapore. NROC membership is <em>required</em> to coach at ActiveSG pools and some condo facilities, though not universally mandatory for all private coaching.</li> <li><strong>ActiveSG Pool Usage:</strong> Per <a href="https://www.activesgcircle.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActiveSG Circle</a>, swimming coaches need a valid NROC certification and Usage Permit to coach in ActiveSG facilities.</li> <li><strong>Condo MCST Rules:</strong> Under the <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA)</a>, MCSTs can establish by-laws governing common facilities. Many condos require external coaches to register with management, limit coaching to residents only, and restrict session times — though policies vary by estate.</li> <li><strong>"Kiasu" Culture:</strong> A widely-used Singaporean term meaning "afraid to lose," describing competitive parenting behaviour, particularly around enrichment activities.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="key-insight"> <h4>⚠️ Verification Note</h4> <p>These are based on publicly available guidelines and common industry knowledge. For a live engagement, I would verify specific regulations with the relevant authorities (SportSG, specific MCST management offices) before making recommendations.</p> <p><strong>The financials are estimates.</strong> Revenue, margins, and student counts are educated guesses based on visible pricing and industry benchmarks — not actual data from the business. In any real pitch, these would need validation.</p> </div> <h2 id="junior">Part 5: The "Junior Marketer" Question</h2> <p>The obvious comparison: <em>"How long would this take without AI?"</em></p> <p>The honest answer: <strong>the process changed for everyone.</strong></p> <p>It's not about "senior + AI beats junior." That's an unfair comparison — you're stacking experience AND tool advantage. The real insight is that both seniors and juniors get a speed boost. The differentiator shifts from "who can grind through research faster" to "who has better judgment and verification skills."</p> <h3>The New Junior Role</h3> <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth and the opportunity:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Old model:</strong> Junior spends 10 hours on research, compiling tabs, formatting PPT</li> <li><strong>New model:</strong> Junior directs AI on what to research, then reviews and verifies</li> </ul> <p>The grunt work isn't eliminated — it's <strong>compressed and restructured</strong>. A junior marketer with good prompting skills and a critical eye can now produce equivalent output in a fraction of the time.</p> <p>This doesn't destroy the learning curve. It <strong>accelerates it</strong>. Instead of spending a week learning "how to compile industry research," you spend a day learning "how to verify AI-generated industry research." The meta-skill (critical evaluation) is actually more valuable.</p> <div class="key-insight"> <h4>💡 The Training Ground Shift</h4> <p>If you're a junior: your job isn't to open 100 tabs anymore. It's to <strong>direct the AI, verify the output, and add the judgment it can't</strong>. That's a more valuable skill set — and it develops faster.</p> </div> <h2 id="limits">Part 6: What This Doesn't Prove</h2> <p>Let me be explicit about the limitations:</p> <div class="exec-summary" style="background: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.1); border-color: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.3);"> <h4>🚫 What This Case Study Does NOT Demonstrate</h4> <ul> <li><strong>That the strategy is validated:</strong> I haven't interviewed actual parents or swimmers. In a real engagement, Day 2+ would involve calling 5-10 customers to validate assumptions.</li> <li><strong>That the financials are accurate:</strong> All numbers are educated estimates, not verified actuals. These would vary significantly business to business.</li> <li><strong>That the pitch converts:</strong> This is a demo, not a closed deal. No money has changed hands.</li> <li><strong>That AI replaces strategic thinking:</strong> I provided the judgment calls and hypotheses; AI provided structure and speed.</li> <li><strong>That agencies are obsolete:</strong> Good agencies provide QA, liability protection, primary research, and domain expertise that this demo lacks.</li> </ul> </div> <p>The key gap is <strong>primary research</strong>. But these hypotheses can be tested through real-world signals: running ads, uploading content, testing product offerings. Then we iterate <em>again</em> based on actual data.</p> <div class="key-insight"> <h4>💡 The Principle</h4> <p>Work <strong>with</strong> AI, not have AI work <strong>for</strong> you. Human judgment + AI speed = leverage. AI alone = expensive first draft.</p> </div> <p>What it <em>does</em> demonstrate:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>production speed</strong> of strategic artefacts has collapsed</li> <li>The <strong>barrier to creating pitch-ready drafts</strong> is now hours, not weeks</li> <li>The <strong>value differentiator</strong> shifts from "production capacity" to "strategic judgment," "validation rigour," and "execution follow-through"</li> </ul> <h2 id="steal">Part 7: What You Can Steal</h2> <h3>The Research Stack</h3> <p>Use this sequence for any industry analysis:</p> <ol> <li><strong>PESTLE</strong> — Macro forces (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)</li> <li><strong>Five Forces</strong> — Industry attractiveness (New Entrants, Buyer Power, Supplier Power, Substitutes, Rivalry)</li> <li><strong>BMC</strong> — Business model of the specific company</li> <li><strong>SWOT/TOWS</strong> — Strategic position and options</li> <li><strong>Recommendations</strong> — What to actually do</li> </ol> <p>Each layer feeds the next. Don't skip the sequence — the TOWS is meaningless without the SWOT, which is meaningless without the BMC, which is meaningless without understanding the industry.</p> <h3>The Workflow Pattern</h3> <ol> <li><strong>You provide context:</strong> Industry-specific knowledge, local regulations, cultural nuance</li> <li><strong>AI provides structure:</strong> Framework templates, synthesis, formatting</li> <li><strong>You provide judgment:</strong> "This insight matters," "This recommendation is actionable," "This number smells wrong"</li> <li><strong>AI provides speed:</strong> First drafts, iteration, presentation</li> <li><strong>You provide verification:</strong> Fact-check sources, validate with cursory competitor research, flag what needs customer interviews</li> </ol> <h3>The Output Stack</h3> <p>Don't stop at a PDF. Build something the client can <em>experience</em>:</p> <ul> <li>Interactive website (even if over-engineered for the context)</li> <li>Working prototype</li> <li>Demo they can click through</li> </ul> <p>This shifts the conversation from "here's my recommendation" to "here's what it looks like." Concrete beats abstract.</p> <h2>The Bottom Line</h2> <p>One afternoon produced:</p> <ul> <li>A complete industry analysis</li> <li>A strategic audit with estimated financials</li> <li>A 4-pillar recommendation set</li> <li>A 90-day execution roadmap</li> <li>An interactive pitch deck</li> </ul> <p>Is it as rigorous as a 3-week consulting engagement with customer interviews and validated financials? No.</p> <p>Is it good enough to start a conversation and demonstrate capability? Yes.</p> <p><strong>Why "$5K-worth"?</strong> Agency discovery phases (industry analysis + business audit + strategic recommendations) typically cost $2,000-$5,000 for comparable scope. By collapsing the drafting phase, I produced equivalent deliverables in one afternoon.</p> <p>The leverage isn't "AI does my thinking." It's <strong>"AI does my grunt work, so I can generate more value in a compressed timeframe."</strong></p> <p>If you can produce $5K worth of deliverables in an afternoon instead of a week, would you not want that?</p> <hr> <p><a href="/swim-coach-demo/" class="demo-link">View the Coach Derrick Pitch Deck →</a></p> <p><a href="/swim-coach-demo/Digital%20Marketing%20Plan.pdf" class="demo-link">Download the Full Strategy PDF →</a></p> <p><a href="/swim-coach-demo/Digital%20Marketing%20Plan%20-%20Coach%20Derrick%20Lim.%20(Slide%20Deck).pdf" class="demo-link">Download the Slide Deck PDF →</a></p> </div> <footer class="article-footer"> <div class="author-bio"> <div class="author-avatar">WK</div> <div class="author-info"> <h4>Winston Koh & Project Athena</h4> <p>This case study was co-authored by Winston and <a href="/athena">Project
