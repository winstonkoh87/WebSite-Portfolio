# Framework: Arena Physics

> **The Law**: "Context dictates Strategy."

Movements that win in one environment (e.g., Academia) are often fatal in another (e.g., Street Fighting). **Arena Physics** is the study of the governing laws of a specific environment before engaging in it.

## The SDR Ratio (Strategic Disadvantage Ratio)

We calculate **SDR** to determine viability:

$$ SDR = \frac{\text{Cost of Failure}}{\text{Probability of Success}} $$

* **SDR < 2**: Favorable. Engage.
* **SDR > 5**: Suicide Mission. Exit or Change the Game.

## The 3 Environments

| Environment | Governing Physics | Optimal Strategy |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Ordered (The Classroom)** | Consistency, Rules, Theory | Study, Comply, Optimize |
| **Chaotic (The Market)** | Speed, Variance, Adaptation | Ship, Test, Pivot |
| **Hostile (The Fight)** | Power, Deception, Survival | Strike First, Asymmetry |

## Application to Engineering

Engineering is not just writing code; it is writing code that survives the environment.

* **Over-engineering** is applying Ordered Physics to a Chaotic problem.
* **Tech Debt** is applying Chaotic Physics to a Hostile problem (Security).

We architect systems by first defining the Arena.
