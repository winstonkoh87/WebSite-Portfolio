# Project Name: Portfolio V2.2 (The Systems Architect)

> **One-Liner**: A high-trust, static portfolio that positions Winston Koh as a "Systems Architect" through Builder Narrative and verifiable artifacts.
> **Target Audience**: High-value clients, technical recruiters, and "Arena" players.
> **Success Metric**: Inbound leads (WhatsApp for SME, Tally for Enterprise) and "Trust" signals.

## 1. The Core Loop

1. **Hook**: `index.html` Hero ("I build systems that run themselves").
2. **Proof Strip**: Verifiable metrics above the fold (4,203 memories, ~1.2s query, 200+ protocols).
3. **Featured Work**: Outcome-led cards (Athena, Brew, Melvin) with "View System →" CTA.
4. **Deep Dive**: `athena.html` rebuilt with Builder Narrative (Terminal, Receipts, The Loop).
5. **Conversion**: Contextual CTA.
   - **SME**: Floating WhatsApp.
   - **Enterprise**: "Initialize Project" (Tally).

## 2. Technical Stack

- **Host**: GitHub Pages. **[NO VERCEL]**
- **Core**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, ES6.
- **Visuals**: Particles.js (low density), JetBrains Mono, dark theme.
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js with custom teal theme.
- **Accessibility**: `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.

## 3. Architecture

- **Root**: `index.html`, `athena.html`, `portfolio.html`.
- **`projects/`**: Self-contained sub-sites (Brew & Bean, Melvin).
- **`assets/`**: Shared Design System (style.css, terminal.css, particles.js, typewriter.js).

## 4. Design Principles (V2.2)

1. **Builder Narrative**: Show the system running, not just the blueprint.
2. **Verifiable Artifacts**: Metrics must be real (memories indexed, query time, protocols).
3. **Anti-Hype**: Calm, specific, technical. No marketing hyperbole.
4. **Local-First Positioning**: Athena is framed as local-first, privacy-respecting.

## 5. Implementation Status

- [x] **Visual Overhaul**: Particles.js restored, terminal typewriter effect.
- [x] **Proof Strip**: Featured Work section with outcome-led cards.
- [x] **Metrics**: Replaced marketing claims with verifiable artifacts.
- [x] **Athena Rebuild**: Builder Narrative (Hero, Problem, Receipts, The Loop, Operator Evidence).
- [x] **Accessibility**: Reduced-motion CSS, semantic HTML.
- [x] **Consistency**: Particles.js on all pages, status badges styled.
- [ ] **Tooling**: Create `build.py` for component stamping (future).
